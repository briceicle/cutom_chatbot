# Project 1: Custom Chatbot
### This Project Has Been Confirmed As Successful By A Udacity Reviewer.

## About
In this project, I built a custom OpenAI chatbot using a dataset of choice.
The dataset I chose is the text from the 2024 Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024). This dataset is appropriate because it includes events that happened after the model (gpt-3.5-turbo) training period. Hence the model is unaware of those events.

To evaluate the custom chatbot, I query the model with and without the custom data to show that it responds differently.
